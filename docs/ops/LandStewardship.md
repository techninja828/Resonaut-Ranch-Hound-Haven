# Land Stewardship

Guidelines for maintaining ecological health across all ranch operations.

## Manure Composting
- Collect stall and yard waste daily to reduce odor and runoff risk.
- Aerate and turn compost piles; cover during heavy rains to maintain proper moisture.
- Cure finished compost for at least six months before field application.

## Stormwater Management
- Grade pens and driveways to divert water into vegetated swales.
- Install gutters and rain barrels to capture roof runoff for reuse.
- Inspect and clear drainage structures before and after major storms.

## Wildlife-Friendly Practices
- Maintain habitat buffers along streams, tree stands, and fence lines.
- Use low-intensity lighting and designated crossings to allow nocturnal movement.
- Avoid barbed wire and include escape gaps so native animals can pass safely.
