# Operations Handbook

- **Daily Rhythm:** AM checks/meds/feeds → Behavior sessions → Enrichment → Intake/Adoptions → PM rounds.
- **Cleanliness:** Zone SOPs, chem logs, laundry cadence.
- **Records:** Every dog has a Behavior Plan, Med Sheet, and Foster Packet; notes in CRM within 24h.
- **People:** Volunteer onboarding, handling levels (L1–L3), shadowing matrix, safety briefings.
- **Communal Kennel:** Rotate play groups on a set schedule; sanitize runs between sets; keep double safety gates latched; automation tasks flag gate checks and cleanings on the daily board.
- **Cabins/RV Prep:** Before arrival, stock linens, test water/power hookups, and clear waste; after checkout, reset and sanitize; automation reminders prompt the reset checklist.
- **Trainer Sessions:** Coordinate family training sessions during stays through the shared calendar; log progress in CRM; automation pings participants with daily session notes.
