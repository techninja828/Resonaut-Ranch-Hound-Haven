# Remote Interaction User Stories

## Live Stream Portal
- *As a casual supporter*, I want to drop into a live stream from my phone so I can see the dogs play during lunch breaks.
- *As a remote volunteer*, I want to use chat to ask handlers questions while watching the training session so I can learn techniques.
- *As a vetted volunteer*, I want to trigger remote treat dispensers from the interface, with staff approval, so I can reinforce good behavior.
- *As a staff moderator*, I want to approve or deny incoming commands and mute users when needed to maintain safety.
