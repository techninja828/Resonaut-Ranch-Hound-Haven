# Open Kennel Ranch

A concept for adapting a working ranch layout to a low-stress dog sanctuary on the Oregon coast. The design favors movement, ventilation, and modular infrastructure that can be built in phases.

## Barn Repurposing
- Convert an existing barn into a multipurpose training hall and treatment center.
- Preserve open floor plan for flexible runs and enrichment setups.
- Add insulation, coastal-grade ventilation, and skylights to handle salty air and damp winters.
- Integrate removable panels so the space can expand or close off as weather and herd size change.

## Herd-Movement Gates
- Use livestock-style, swing-and-slide gates to guide dog groups between play fields, barns, and quarantine zones.
- Arrange gates in a hub-and-spoke pattern for one-person operation and low-stress transfers.
- Maintain two-gate "airlock" entries on all pens to prevent accidental releases.

## Quarantine Zones
- Dedicated pens with separate drainage and airflow for new intakes or medical cases.
- Surface materials chosen for easy sanitization and runoff capture so waste does not reach wetlands.
- Positioned upwind of main population to reduce airborne transmission.

## Visitor Cabins
- Small, self-contained cabins for volunteers, adopters, or short-term fosters.
- Placed outside core dog movement areas but within sight-lines for supervision.
- Designed for off-season rentals to offset maintenance costs.

## Oregon Coastal Property Considerations
### Fencing
- Use galvanized or composite fencing that resists corrosion from salt spray.
- Set posts deep in sandy soil and brace for high winds; include wildlife-friendly spacing.
- Install perimeter fencing plus internal cross-fencing aligned with herd-movement gate plan.

### Water
- Verify well capacity or municipal hook-up; supplement with rainwater capture and greywater reuse.
- Grade surfaces and install French drains to manage heavy winter rains.
- Protect nearby streams and wetlands through berms and vegetative buffers.

### Zoning
- Kennel/sanctuary use may require a conditional use permit under coastal county codes.
- Observe setbacks from property lines, wetlands, and tsunami inundation zones.
- Visitor cabins must comply with transient lodging and septic regulations.
