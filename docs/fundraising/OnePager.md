**Problem:** High-risk dogs are first to be euthanized; behavior cases and owner-surrender cycles overwhelm shelters.  
**Solution:** A sanctuary that specializes in rehab + foster enablement + owner education, anchored by transparent KPIs.  
**How You Can Help:** Sponsor a kennel/run, fund a foster cohort, underwrite vet care, volunteer, host a clinic day.  
**Outcomes:** Fewer euthanasias, safer adoptions, trained owners, healthier community.
