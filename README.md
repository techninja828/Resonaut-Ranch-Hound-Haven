# Coast Dog Sanctuary

**One-liner:** Rescue, rehab, rehome — and train the humans. Sanctuary for the hard cases.

## Mission
Save high-risk dogs through evidence-based rehabilitation, foster pipelines, and lifetime sanctuary care when needed — while educating owners and strengthening the local rescue ecosystem.

## Vision
A scalable, data-driven sanctuary model that any county can replicate: transparent metrics, open SOPs, and community partnerships that turn "unadoptable" into adoptable.

## Theory of Change
Inputs (partners, trainers, fosters, donors) → Activities (intake, vetting, behavior plans, foster support, adoption matching, education) → Outputs (dogs rehabilitated, adoptions, reduced returns) → Outcomes (lower shelter euthanasia, safer adoptions, informed owners) → Impact (community-wide humane capacity).

## 12-Month Milestones
- **Capacity:** 10 kennel-equivalents + 15 active fosters + trainer-of-trainers cohort.
- **Outcomes:** 120 intakes, 90 adoptions, <5% returns, 20 sanctuary residents in behavior maintenance.
- **Ops:** SOPs live, volunteer/trainer onboarding, CRM + donor infra, website + donation flow.
- **Funding:** $250k run-rate via monthly donors, local sponsors, and small grants.

## 30/60/90 Day Plan (high level)
- **30:** Choose legal path (fiscal sponsor vs. start 501(c)(3)), stand up website + donation, publish Sponsor Packages, recruit Founding Partners & Board/Advisors, start Foster-10 Campaign.
- **60:** Launch training & foster enablement program, run 2 community events (adoption & education), submit 3 grants, publish KPI dashboard.
- **90:** Secure land/long-lease options (or expand foster-first), formal MOU network with shelter, vet(s), trainer(s); publish Q1 Impact Report.

## Core Programs
1) **Rescue & Intake**  2) **Behavior & Rehab**  3) **Foster & Adoption**  4) **Lifetime Sanctuary Care**  5) **Owner Education**  6) **Community Spay/Neuter & Clinics (partner-led)**
